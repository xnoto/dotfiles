# OpenCode configuration for agent-hub-daemon integration
# 
# The agent-hub-daemon auto-starts a headless hub server (opencode serve --port 4096)
# which provides HTTP API access to ALL sessions. User TUI instances don't need
# to start their own servers - they just create sessions the hub can see.
#
# To manually start a server (e.g., if daemon isn't running):
#   opencode --port 4096
